# Pohod15
Model of a bio-inspired robotic leg.


# ActuatorControl  
Provide the STM32 code, for actuator position control, 3DoF leg inverse kinematics and trajectory generation.  
The projet was configured using STM32CubeMX software (NUCLEO STM32F411RE setup). We suggest to use STM32Studio for the code developpment.
