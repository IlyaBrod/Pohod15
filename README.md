    <h1> Description: </h1>
    This project presents the design of a 3 DoF bio-inspired robotic leg. The desert ant <i>Cataglyphis fortis</i> was used as a reference for segment sizing, with a scale ratio of 1:30.<br><br>
The structure is mainly composed of FDM 3D-printed parts. An additional carbon fiber shaft is used for the tibia, and a silicone molded tip improves surface adherence.<br>  
The actuation system consists of 3 DC motors (MABUCHI RK-370CC-14230), controlled with a custom-built shield made of L298N. However, nowadays, there are good Pololu control boards available (<a href="https://www.pololu.com/category/10/brushed-dc-motor-controllers">Pololu control boards</a>).<br>  
An irreversible worm-gear system is built using custom-machined axes jointed to Delrin straight gears to double the motor's torque output. These parts can also be assembled from cut threaded rods.<br>  
Angular sensors are based on the AS5600 from AMS OSRAM manufacturer. <br><br>
    <h1>  Files: </h1>
    <h3>./Pohod15ExoC</h3>
              CAD assembly files for Solidworks. An aditional .STEP model is provided.
    <h3>./ActuatorControl</h3>
              Provide the STM32 code, for actuator position control, 3DoF leg inverse kinematics and trajectory generation.  <br><br>
              The projet was configured using STM32CubeMX software (NUCLEO STM32F411RE setup). We suggest to use STM32Studio for the code developpment.   
    <h3>./Joint sizing  </h3> 
              Provide a graphical software to choose manually the optimum size of the irreversible joint, depending the desired output torque.
